# A follow through of Fireship's react full course 

- The course was done in vanilla JS. I spent the bulk of the process of doing this course learning Typescript
- Solidified my understanding in tailwind styling, hooks, and creating dynamic react UIs.

# Result

I stopped short of implementing any of the PWA features. So it works as a SPA
